That's my shell which should be user friendly and look really nice.  
It's recommended that you use **VSCode** + **Windows Terminal** or **Tabby** if preffered.  
In both of above programmes you have to set some of NerdFonts as FaceFont.  

Setup bases on the:
* Catpuccin Mocha themes
* Starship Prompt
* LunarVim (lvim) 
* tmux
    * tpm
    * tmux-sensible
    * tmux-yank
    * vim-tmux-navigator
* zsh
    * zsh-abbr
    * zsh-autosuggestions
    * zsh-syntax-highlighting
    * zsh-z


I handled all of the necessary dependencies for the applications and mods above so you don't have to, however i am not sure how will it work in the future when new versions of software will drop.

```diff
- WARNING! It's a good practice to have newest nodejs, npm and rustc installed, because the dependencies are really picky here - look for the problems there at first.
- Works on Debian/Ubuntu only because of apt and names of packets in these OSes.
```
