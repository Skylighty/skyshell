# ‚≠ê About & Help ‚≠ê

This shell customization solution bases on ZSH and Starship Prompt.  
It's recommended that you use **VSCode** + **Windows Terminal**.  
In both of above programmes you have to set some of NerdFonts as FaceFont.

**Before you inject SSH startup script, use ssh-keygen! (more about below)**  

**If any problems do occur or you do want to contact, catch me on GitHub.**  

```diff
- WARNING! Execute this script as root!
```

## ‚≠ê SSH-Key - Optional ‚≠ê  

‚û°Ô∏è In the shell use ssh-keygen (for id_rsa key) with password of your choice  
‚û°Ô∏è Check if private and public keys are added: `ls ~/.ssh/`  
‚û°Ô∏è Should return: id_rsa (your private key), id_rsa.pub (your public key)  
‚û°Ô∏è Start ssh agent in the background: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`  
‚û°Ô∏è The process' PID should appear in format **Agent pid <nr>**  
‚û°Ô∏è Add private key to ssh-agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/ida_rsa`  
‚û°Ô∏è Add public key to GitHub so you can authenticate to GH server  
    üîê https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account  
‚û°Ô∏è Now you can execute script again and select option 4. to run ssh-agent with your privkey on every shell login
