# ‚≠ê About & Help ‚≠ê

This shell customization solution bases on ZSH and Starship Prompt.  
It's recommended that you use **VSCode** + **Windows Terminal**.  
In both of above programmes you have to set some of NerdFonts as FaceFont.  

This was made as an automatization with a little of my customization to The Digital Life dotfiles:
- https://github.com/xcad2k/dotfiles

Download here:
- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/FiraCode.zip

Files digital-life-theme.xaml and schemes.json are theme files which i didn't use,  
but they might come handy if someone wants to develop full, uniform setup and dev stack üòÅ.  

‚≠ê For the Windows Terminal color scheme & font settings visit **wTERMINAL.md**.

**Before you inject SSH startup script, use ssh-keygen! (more about below)**  

**If any problems do occur or you do want to contact, catch me on GitHub.**  

```diff
- WARNING! Execute this script as root!
```
